## Overview of the analysis

#### This analysis seeks to comapare ride fares in different types of cities with a view to making necessary adjustments, if any, in how charges are calculated.


## Results

#### The analysis show that the total fare rural, suburban, and urban cities are high, higher, and highest as indicated in the plot. However, looking at the summary table, it will be easily observed that the number of rides is also in that order which is expected. The average fare per driver is however in the reverse order which suggest that the rural drivers receive higher average fare tha their suburban and urban counterparts.

## Summary
The total fare for rural, suburban, and urban city types go in the order of high, higher, and highest; while the average fare per driver go in the reverse order and this is explained by the corresponding difference in number of rides. It is therefore recommended that no changes be made to fare calculations at this time
